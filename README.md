# molecules-clustering-generation
Research Project - Mines Nancy

Project in collaboration with a PhD researcher from LORIA (one and a half days per week) as part of my Mines de Nancy curriculum.

### Molecules Clustering

##### Molecules clustering on quantitative data 
I used different clustering algorithms to cluster molecules from the ESOL_delaney-processed dataset only with quantitative data and compared the results according to three metrics.

##### Molecules clustering using SMILES representation
I followed the methods and the scripts of two papers to cluster molecules from the compound-annotation dataset and compared the results according to three metrics.


### Molecules Generation

I compared two principal methods to generate new molecules : GAN and Diffusion process.

For the methods based on diffusion process, I followed the scripts of 3 articles and 2 articles for methods based on GAN.

To compare the results of each method, I used the same QM9 dataset and three metrics.
